# Szymon Lurka - Front End Developer

 I am Szymek, Front End Developer with 2 years of experience. 
 
 I have experience with `React`, `Angular`, and am currently working in `Vue`. I love front-end technologies, although I am learning backend after hours (especially `NodeJS`, server management and stuff like that).
 
 I am currently developing ecommerce applications based on `Vue/Nuxt` + `VueStoreFront` and HeadlessCMS (e.g. `Contentful`) and other software (e.g. `CommerceTools`).
Most of my activity is currently located [here](https://github.com/LurkaSzymon).
