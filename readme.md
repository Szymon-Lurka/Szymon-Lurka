# Szymon Lurka - Front End Developer

 I am Szymek, Front End Developer with 3 years of experience. 
 
 I have experience with `React`, `Angular`, and am currently working in `Vue`. I love front-end technologies, although I am learning backend after hours (especially `NodeJS`, server management and stuff like that).

 Lately I've been spending a lot of my learning time on nodeJS (plus cloud, CI/CD, databases, etc).
